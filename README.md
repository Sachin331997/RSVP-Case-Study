# RSVP-Case-Study


Problem Statement:

RSVP Movies, a successful Indian film production company, is known for making hit movies primarily targeting the Indian audience. However, they're now preparing to release a movie for the global audience in 2022. To make informed decisions for this new project, they want to use data analysis. They've given us data on movies released in the past three years. Our task is to analyze this data and find useful insights to help them kickstart their global project successfully.
